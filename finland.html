The course "User Inspired Design" made me realize the power of empathy, taking me step by step towards human-centered design.<br><br>Helsinki, for me, it’s a place with serenity. I enjoyed waking up early, making myself a breakfast and meditating in the calm atmosphere. Also, the scenery is too good to be true!</p></div><div class="col-4 col-m-3"></div></div>

It addresses the questions what, why, who, when. The language used in the invitation is avoiding design related jargon and the pictures and fonts are communicating empathy towards the participants by using children-friendly features.<br><br>
We made a test workshop with the students and found out that there were things to improve. Our workshop aimed at understanding the parents of young children and their feelings during everyday life. We use stickers for the participants to communicate their emotions and noticed how the stickers helped the participants to recall and discuss their experiences. Also by offering options we made it easier to talk about all kind of feelings.</p></div><div class="col-3 col-m-3"></div></div>

In the workshop we worked a lot on creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere for our participants: using relaxing music, flowers and offering coffee and some snacks for the mothers and baby food for the babies. The mother noticed our effort and were appreciating: "Oh, you have also baby food!"<br><br>We had to be flexible to deal with unexpected situations since we were not familiar with the topic of parenting. In the workshop, babies were keeping the mothers busy so the mothers had to multitask a lot. I also played with one of the babies to give the mother space to focus on the tasks.</p></div><div class="col-3 col-m-3"></div></div>
